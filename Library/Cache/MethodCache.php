/**
 * MethodCache
 *
 * Calls in Zephir implement monomorphic and polimorphic caches to
 * improve performance. Method/Functions lookups are cached in a standard
 * first-level method lookup cache.
 *
 * The concept of inline caching is based on the empirical observation
 * that the objects that occur at a particular call site are often of the same type
 * Internal functions are considered monomorphic since they do not change across execution.
 * Final and private methods are also monomorphic because of their own nature.
 * Due to the Ahead-Of-Time compilation approach provided by Zephir, is not possible
 * to implement inline caches, however is possible to add barriers/guards to
 * take advantage of profile guided optimizations (PGO) and branch prediction.
 *
 * This implementation is based on the work of HÃ¶lzle, Chambers and Ungar [1].
